                <p>I read this book for fun during a golf tournament weekend one summer. Another parent saw me and said, "Reading a math textbook? You're going to be rich one day!"</p>
                <p>But I don't want to chase riches. I want to chase truth and logic and purity.</p>
                <p>I chose this book. So I chose to study math.</p>
                <p>This was many years ago. Now, I still study math. But I'm no ordinary mathematician. I am the Best Mathematician.</p>
                <p>I spent my days analyzing the abstract world. I even got a theorem named after me. History will remember me.</p>
                <em>The human mind invented math. I invented my life.</em>
                <p>I lived for myself, and I became the best. Now what? Uh oh.</p>
                <p>Maybe I should have chosen <a href="the-little-prince.html">The Little Prince</a> and thought about actual matters of consequence.</p>
