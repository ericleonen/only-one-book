                <p>One summer, I listened to this book as an audiobook while doing chores: washing the dishes, cleaning the car, tidying the house...</p>
                <p>I chose this book. So I chose to appreciate the small things in life. I chose to fear dreaming big.</p>
                <p>This was many years ago. I became Just Another Person. And I'm content with my life.</p>
                <p>Wake up. Work. Eat. Relax. Clean. Sleep. Repeat.</p>

                <p>Maybe I should have chosen <a href="fahrenheit-451.html">Fahrenheit 451</a> and learned how to lead a courageous, meaningful life.</p>
