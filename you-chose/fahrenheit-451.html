                <p>In a highschool english class, I was told to choose a book for a reading project. I chose this book because it was so short. Little did I know, this book's ending made me tear up.</p>
                <p>I chose this book. So I chose to fight the terrors of mass media and censorship and all things selfish. I chose to live for others.</p>
                <p>This was many years ago. I became Whatever the World Wanted Me to Become. I help who I can help. I am the least important person.</p>

                <p>I am dying now. They will hold ceremonies and a funeral for me. I will be remembered by others. But what about me?</p>
                <p>Maybe I should pursued my selfish interest in mathematics. What if I had chosen <a href="where-math-comes-from.html">Where Math Comes From</a>?</p>
