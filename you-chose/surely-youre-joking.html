                <p>I read this book the summer before I started college. The life of Feynman reinvigorated my love for science and discovery.</p>
                <p>I chose this book. So I chose to be just like Feynman: a genius scientist and an even more genius teacher.</p>
                <p>This was many years ago. Now, I am a Celebrated Scientist. I push the boundaries of AI. Make it faster. Make it smarter. Make it cheaper.</p>

                    “I always do that, get into something and see how far I can go.”
                </a></em>
                <p>And I did. And now, the AI Singularity is within grasp. Finally, we can replace humanity. Finally. Hmmm...</p>
                <p>Maybe I should have chosen <a href="brave-new-world.html">Brave New World</a> and thought about the dangers of technology.</p>
