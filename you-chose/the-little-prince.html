                <p>I read this tale at least two times. Once, begrudingly, as a child. Once again, grasping for meaning, as a freshman in college after studying hard for my first final exams.</p>

                <p>Maybe I could have focused on one thing. Maybe I should have chosen <a href="surely-youre-joking.html">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman</a> and became focused man of science.</p>
