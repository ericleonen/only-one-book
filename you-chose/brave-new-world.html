                <p>I first listened to this book as an audiobook while riding the lightrail home. How ironic! The book ruthlessly criticizes modern technology including digital entertainment and high-speed transportation.</p>
                <p>I chose this book. So, I chose to hate science and technology. Technology strips away individual identity.</p>
                <p>This was many years ago. Now, I am a Recluse Living in the Wild. I built my own shelter. I hunt my own food. And I am happy.</p>
                <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/40797-but-i-don-t-want-comfort-i-want-god-i-want">
                    "I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin."
                </a></em>
                <p>But I'm in pain. Constant pain. I'm tired. I'm tired of surviving. The wild is dangerous.</p>
                <p>Maybe I should have chosen <a href="of-mice-and-men.html">Of Mice and Men</a> and sought a safer life.</p>
